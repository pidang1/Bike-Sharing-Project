  <h1>Analysis of Washington D.C. Bike-Share Data</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>For our project, we wanted to explore bike sharing data in 
    Washington D.C. and learn more about what factors affect the 
    amount of customers that the bike sharing system has. This is 
    an important topic to explore because using a bike share system 
    in cities can be a great way to reduce the environmental issues 
    caused by cars or other types of transportation, such as increased 
    use of electricity, gasoline consumption, and carbon emissions.
     However, while a bike share system is a good solution in theory, 
     it can be difficult to implement practically because of weather 
     and seasonal related issues that reduce the number of customers 
     willing to bike. Therefore, it is highly relevant to look at past 
     data and analyze trends in bike share usage based on weather and 
     season data to assess the situations where bike shares are more popular 
     and which situations usually result in fewer bike share users. 
     This information can be critical to understanding patterns in bike 
     share usage, and could even help inform how future advertising and 
     marketing techniques for bike shares can be set up. </p>

  <p>Numerous studies have been conducted in this topic area, as bike sharing in cities 
    has become increasingly popular for many reasons, including practical and environmental 
    factors. A study done by the 
    <a href="https://www.academia.edu/81352256/How_does_the_weather_affect_the_shared_bicycle_usage">Danish Journal of Transportation Research</a>  
    analyzed shared
     bicycle usage in Oslo during the 2017 season, examining how weather, specifically rain 
     and temperature, impacts trip patterns. The data reveals that weather affects both the 
     number and type of trips made. Rain negatively impacts usage, particularly for long and
      slow trips, while fast trips and those during morning rush hours are less affected. 
      Warmer temperatures increase the number of trips, with the biggest effect in the evening, 
      and slow-paced trips are more influenced by warm weather than fast-paced ones. The 
      research highlights how weather can shape cycling habits and offers insights for 
      transportation planning, suggesting that shared bicycles provide a flexible travel 
      option, especially for short trips, regardless of weather. </p>

  <p>Another interesting and more recent <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10112160">study</a> links 
    shared rides and weather patterns affected by climate change. 
    This study explores how weather, specifically ambient temperature, affects bike share usage in New York City,
     using data from 37 million Citi Bike® rides from 2013 to 2017. It reveals a nonlinear relationship where 
     ridership increases with rising temperatures but drops when temperatures exceed 26–28°C. By combining this
      data with climate projections, the researchers estimate how future temperature changes due to climate change 
      could impact biking behavior. They predict overall increases in bike usage by mid-century, driven by warmer 
      winters, springs, and falls, though extreme summer heat could eventually cause decline. This study highlights 
      the importance of considering weather patterns in understanding the future implications of climate change on 
      bike share programs.</p>

  

  <h3>Data Introduction & Data Cleaning</h3>

  <p> This analysis is based on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juliajemals/bike-sharing-washington-dc">bike-sharing dataset</a> from Kaggle that contains 
    2,922 rows and 29 columns. This dataset hosts a multitude of attributes 
    of weather condition, temperature reading, and bike usage statistics. The 
    variables include average, minimum, and maximum temperatures (temp_avg, temp_min,
     temp_max), precipitation, wind speed, and a few binary variables of specific weather 
     types, such as fog, rain, thunder, and more. It also contains data on bike sharing, 
     which is basically the number of casual and registered users: casual, registered, 
     and an aggregate number of customers: total_cust. This data was derived from 
     <a href="https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data">records of the bike-sharing program </a>
     matched with the
     <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search"> weather data</a> of the local area
      to have a look into the effects caused by weather conditions on bike use.</p> 
      
      <p>To clean this data, we first dealt with missing values in many columns like weather conditions, holiday data, and customer count. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filled missing (NaN) weather condition values with 0 
        </li>
        <li>Set missing holiday data to 0, indicating no holiday
        </li>
        <li>Calculated missing “temp_avg” using temp_min and temp_max</li>
        <li>Dropped rows where there was missing customer information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After the cleaning, there were no remaining NaN values and a total of 2,918 observations. 
        Additionally, we wanted to create visualizations with seasons, which wasn't originally
        included in the dataset. So, we calculated and added a new attribute ‘season’ by mapping dates to a specific 
        season based on predefined ranges. After data cleaning, the attributes in the dataset were:
      </p>

      <h3>What are the trends of bike share data over time?</h3>

      <p> To begin our analysis of the data, we first created a line graph that represents the overall trend of 
        data over time. More specifically, it displays the number of bike share 
        customers each day from 2011 to 2018 in Washington D.C. There is an interactive 
        component to the plot where if you select a section of data on the line plot, 
        a bar chart will populate to the right that has information about the number of 
        entries in each season.There is also a tooltip interaction where users can hover 
      over a point in the chart and will be provided information about that day's maximum temperature
      and number of casual and registered customers. </p>

        <p>It can be seen that there is a cyclical trend in the data where every year, 
          there is a rise and fall of the data corresponding to the seasons (for example, 
          there is usually a relative peak in the data around July of each year and a relative minimum 
          in the data around January). Additionally, it can be observed that the data has a 
          positive trend overall indicating that as time has gone on, more and more customers 
          have started using the bike share system, especially in the summer months. This suggests 
          that the bike share system has increased in popularity over time and also indicates that 
          more people are likely to use the bike share system during the warmer seasons.

          <div class = 'center'>
              <iframe src="linechart.html" width="100%" height="430px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div>
          
          
        
          <h3>How does weather type impact total customers?</h3>

          <p>
            We were then curious to see trends in weather type and how it might affect bike-share usage.
            The bar chart illustrates how various weather conditions influence the mean 
            number of total customers. Notably, days with thunder attract the highest average 
            number of customers, approximately 9,000, followed by days with fog, haze, and hail,
             all exceeding an average of 7,000 customers. Heavy fog and high wind also show 
             relatively high customer counts, indicating that these conditions do not significantly 
             deter customer activity. In contrast, less favorable weather types such as freezing 
             drizzle, drifting snow, freezing rain, and unknown conditions correspond to lower mean
              customer numbers, with averages below 4,000. This suggests that adverse or uncertain 
              weather conditions may negatively impact customer turnout, whereas more stable or dramatic 
              weather conditions, like thunder or fog, might either be less impactful or even coincide with 
              increased activity due to other factors. Overall, the chart provides insight into how different 
              weather types correlate with customer behavior.

          </div>

      <h3>How do casual and registered customers differ?</h3>
      
      <p> We next noted that there was a distinction between casual and registered customers in the dataset,
        and wanted to see if there were any differences that could be seen with these variables. We created
        histograms of the distribution of casual and registered customers, where it can be seen that the casual 
        distribution has a lower mean and is positively skewed, while the registered distribution
         is fairly symmetrical with a higher mean. This suggests that it's more likely for there to 
         be a high number of registered customers on any given day than it is for there to be casual
          customers, which might indicate customers who are registered are more consistently using 
          the bike share platform.
      </p>

      <div class = 'center'>
              <iframe src="project_histogram.html" width="100%" height="430px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          
                    
      </div>
      
      <h3> How does precipitation impact total bike share customers?</h3>

      <p>
        After observing that both weather type and customer registration status could affect bike-share usage,
        we then wanted to explore the interplay of these factors.
        This visualization shows the relationship between bike-sharing rentals and 
        precipitation, with three views: casual customers, registered customers, 
        and total customers (casual + registered). The interactive dropdown on this plot can 
      be used to switch between the views. The tooltip interaction also reveals maximum temperature
      and wind speed data for each point the user hovers over.
    </p>
      <p>This plot reveals how different types 
        of customers respond to weather conditions, with casual customers generally 
        showing a stronger decline in rentals as precipitation increases, while registered 
        customers may be less affected due to regular use for commuting. The total customer
         plot combines both groups, offering insights into overall bike rental trends in
          response to precipitation (in general, higher precipitation leads to lower bike-share usage).
      </p>

      <div class = 'center'>
          
            <iframe src="precip_scatter.html" width="100%" height="430px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          
          </div>   
      </div>

      
      
      <h3> How does temperature impact total bike share customers? </h3>

      <p>Finally, we looked into temperature's impact on bike-share usage.
        This visualization shows the relationship between maximum temperature and the total number 
        of bike-sharing customers. We also added an interactive slider that filters data points by their max temperature value, 
        allowing users to focus on specific ranges of temperature.
        We can see that as the temperature increases, the number of customers
         generally increases. This means that warmer days encourage more people to use the bike system, 
         while colder days have lower amount of customers. However, extreme temperatures above 30°C seem 
         to result in fewer users as well. 
    </p>

      <div class = 'center'>
          <iframe src="temperature.html" width="100%" height="430px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      


      


      <h3>Conclusion </h3>

      <p>
        In summary, this project's work will be useful for having a better 
        understanding of the factors that impact bike share usage in Washington 
        DC. These visualizations suggest that increases in bike share usage 
        could be associated with:
 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>spring/summer seasons</li>
        <li>not certain weather types (ex. freezing rain/drizzle, ice fog)</li>
        <li>registered customers</li>
        <li>low precipitation (especially with casual customers)</li>
        <li>a higher maximum temperature (but not too high)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ultimately, this knowledge can be critical in informing when the bike 
        share system is more likely to be used, and can help figure out how to 
        increase user retention. For example, the city could put out an ad campaign 
        to encourage people to register for the bike share, which could increase the
         likelihood that they will use the system. Additionally, they could switch 
         out the bikes during colder seasons with tires with better traction for 
         snow/sleet weather, or provide fog headlamps, which could also encourage
          more people to use the bike share on off weather days. 

          However, it should be noted that this data (2011-2018) is not up-to-date, and there could 
          have been changes in trends in recent years that would not have been captured
          by these visualizations.
